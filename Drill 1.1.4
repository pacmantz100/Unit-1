Drill 1.1.4

1. E-Commerce company selling three goods:
      1. widgets 
      2. doodads
      3. fizzbangs
  
  Data on sessions:
      1. activity on website
      2. pageviews
      3. purchases
      4. referred from advertisement
      5. cost and price information
 
 We could test:
     1. for each item in each category of goods, see how cost and price information drove pageviews and ultimately purchases by categorizing each good by their cost and price.
     2. how many pageviews and then purchases were driven by advertisement referral
     3. how keywords (activity on website) affected pageviews and purchases


2. Onboarding Funnel 
       1. email password signup,  plan choice, payment
  Data  on users:
       1. steps completed
       2. time stamps of completion of steps
       3. marketing spend 

 We could test:
     1. see amount of time on each step and see which takes longest, and which are left incomplete...this could indicate too much complication in a single step
     2. marketing spend ? how would we use this?
     3. if payment time on  site is too long, maybe too expensive or too compliated to sign up
     
3. Hotel site
    1. ranks search results by price
    2. one city  100 hotels
  Data on site:
      1. session information
      2. price information
      3. availability  of hotels
      
We could rank by:
    1. availability first, then  price information
    2. if less available, is it more expsneive?
    
4. Social network churn
    Data on users:
        1. login timestamps
        2. session length
 We could test:
     1. too  boring? amount of time
     2. too annoying?  amount of ads on page related to length of time
